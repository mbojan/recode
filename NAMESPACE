S3method(recode, data.frame

If \code{fromto} is a data frame, then it is expected to have two columns.
The mode of the result is determined by the mode of the second column of
\code{fromto}. For each 'i', values of \code{x} equal to \code{fromto[i,1]}
are replaced with \code{fromto[i,2]}.)
S3method(recode, default

If \code{fromto} is a vector it should have an even number of elements. It is
interpreted such that values \code{x = fromto[i]} is recoded into a value
\code{fromto[i+1]}, \code{x = fromto[i+2]} into \code{fromto[i+3]} and so on.)
S3method(recode, matrix

If \code{fromto} is a matrix, it is converted to a data frame and an
appropriate method is used.)
